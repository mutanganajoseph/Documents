mysql -u root -p

alter user 'root'@'localhost'
identified by 'new_password';
flush privileges;
exit

In case you've forgotten the root password

If you've forgotten the root password and cannot log in, you will need to reset the password by following these steps:

1. Stop MySQL service

sudo systemctl stop mysql

2. Start MySQL in Safe Mode (skip grant tables)

This allows you to log in without needing a password.

sudo mysqld_safe --skip-grant-tables &

This will start MySQL in a mode where authentication is disabled.

3. Log in to MySQL

Now, log in to MySQL without a password:

mysql -u root

4. Change the root password
After logging in, run the following command to update the password:

USE mysql;
UPDATE user SET authentication_string=PASSWORD('new_password') WHERE User='root';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

5. Restart MySQL service

Exit MySQL and restart the MySQL service to apply the changes:

sudo systemctl start mysql

You should now be able to log in using the new root password.

Setting a password for other users

To set or change the password for a non-root MySQL user:

1. Log in to MySQL as root or an admin user.


2. Use the following SQL command:



ALTER USER 'username'@'hostname' IDENTIFIED BY 'new_password';

Replace 'username', 'hostname', and 'new_password' with the actual username, host (usually 'localhost'), and desired new password.

3. Flush privileges:



FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

4. Exit MySQL:



EXIT;
