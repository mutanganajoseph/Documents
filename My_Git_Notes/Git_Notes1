Linking your GitHub account to your PC involves setting up Git and configuring SSH keys for secure authentication. Here are the steps to link your GitHub account on your PC:

### 1. Install Git
First, ensure that Git is installed on your PC. You can download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads) and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

### 2. Configure Git
Once Git is installed, you need to configure your Git username and email. Open your terminal (or Git Bash on Windows) and run the following commands:

```sh
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

### 3. Generate SSH Key
Next, you need to generate an SSH key to securely connect to GitHub. In your terminal, run:

```sh
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.email@example.com"
```

If you're using an older system that doesn't support the `ed25519` algorithm, use:

```sh
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your.email@example.com"
```

When prompted to "Enter a file in which to save the key," press Enter to accept the default file location. You can also set a passphrase for added security.

### 4. Add SSH Key to SSH Agent
Start the SSH agent and add your SSH key:

```sh
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

If you used the `rsa` algorithm, the command would be:

```sh
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

### 5. Add SSH Key to GitHub
Copy the SSH key to your clipboard:

```sh
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

(or `cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` for RSA)

Select and copy the output.

Then, go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and follow these steps:
1. Sign in to your GitHub account.
2. Go to your profile settings.
3. Click on "SSH and GPG keys" in the sidebar.
4. Click the "New SSH key" button.
5. Paste your SSH key into the "Key" field and give it a descriptive title.
6. Click "Add SSH key."

### 6. Test SSH Connection
To verify that your PC is properly linked to your GitHub account, run:

```sh
ssh -T git@github.com
```

You should see a message like:

```
Hi your-username! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
```

### 7. Clone a Repository
Now you can clone repositories using SSH. For example:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:your-username/your-repository.git
```

That's it! Your GitHub account is now linked to your PC, and you can start working with your repostory.
